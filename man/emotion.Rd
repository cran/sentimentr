\arguments{
\item{text.var}{The text variable.  Can be a \code{get_sentences} object or
a raw character vector though \code{get_sentences} is preferred as it avoids
the repeated cost of doing sentence boundary disambiguation every time
\code{sentiment} is run.}

\item{emotion_dt}{A \pkg{data.table} with a \code{token} and \code{emotion}
column (\code{tokens} are nested within the \code{emotion}s.  The table
cannot contain any duplicate rows and must have the \code{token} column set
as the key column (see \code{?data.table::setkey}).  The default emotion
table is \code{lexicon::hash_nrc_emotions}.}

\item{valence_shifters_dt}{A \pkg{data.table} of valence shifters that
can alter a polarized word's meaning and an integer key for negators (1),
amplifiers [intensifiers] (2), de-amplifiers [downtoners] (3) and adversative 
conjunctions (4) with x and y as column names.  For this purpose only 
negators is required/used.}

\item{drop.unused.emotions}{logical.  If \code{TRUE} unused/unfound emotion
levels will not be included in the output.}

\item{un.as.negation}{logical.  If \code{TRUE} then emotion words prefixed
with an 'un-' are treated as a negation.  For example,\code{"unhappy"} would 
be treated as \code{"not happy"}.  If an emotion word has an un- version in the
\code{emotion_dt} then no substitution is performed and an optional warning
will be given.}

\item{un.as.negation.warn}{logical.  If \code{TRUE} and if 
\code{un.as.negation} id \code{TRUE}, then a warning will be given if the 
-un version of an emotion term is already found within the \code{emotion_dt}.
Note that the default \code{emotion_dt}, \code{lexicon::hash_nrc_emotions}, 
will not give a warning unless it is explicitly set to do so.  There are
a number of emotion words in \code{lexicon::hash_nrc_emotions} that contain
un- prefixed versions already in the dictionary. Use:
\code{emotion('', un.as.negation.warn = TRUE)} to see these un- prefixed
emotion words that are contained within \code{lexicon::hash_nrc_emotions}.}

\item{n.before}{The number of words to consider as negated before
the emotion word.  To consider the entire beginning portion of a sentence
use \code{n.before = Inf}.  Note that a comma, colon, or semicolon acts as a 
boundary for considered words.  Only words between the emotion word and these
punctuation types will be considered.}

\item{n.after}{The number of words to consider as negated after
the emotion word.  To consider the entire ending portion of a sentence
use \code{n.after = Inf}.  Note that a comma, colon, or semicolon acts as a 
boundary for considered words.  Only words between the emotion word and these
punctuation types will be considered.}

\item{retention_regex}{A regex of what characters to keep.  All other 
characters will be removed.  Note that when this is used all text is lower 
case format.  Only adjust this parameter if you really understand how it is 
used.  Note that swapping the \code{\\\\{p}} for \code{[^[:alpha:];:,\']} may 
retain more alpha letters but will likely decrease speed.}

\item{\ldots}{ignored.}
}
\value{
Returns a \pkg{data.table} of:
\itemize{
  \item element_id - The id number of the original vector passed to \code{emotion}
  \item sentence_id - The id number of the sentences within each \code{element_id}
  \item word_count - Word count
  \item emotion_type - Type designation from the \code{emotion} column of the \code{emotion_dt} table
  \item emotion_count - Count of the number of emotion words of that \code{emotion_type}
  \item emotion - A score of the percentage of emotion words of that \code{emotion_type}
}
}
\description{
Detect the rate of emotion at the sentence level.  This method uses a simple
dictionary lookup to find emotion words and then compute the rate per sentence.
The \code{emotion} score ranges between 0 (no emotion used) and 1 (all
words used were emotional).  Note that a single emotion phrase would count as 
just one in the \code{emotion_count} column but would count as two words in
the \code{word_count} column.
