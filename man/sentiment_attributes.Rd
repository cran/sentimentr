\title{Extract Sentiment Attributes from Text}
\usage{
sentiment_attributes(text.var, polarity_dt = lexicon::hash_sentiment_jockers,
  valence_shifters_dt = lexicon::hash_valence_shifters, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{text.var}{The text variable.}

\item{polarity_dt}{A \pkg{data.table} of positive/negative words and
weights with x and y as column names.}

\item{valence_shifters_dt}{A \pkg{data.table} of valence shifters that
can alter a polarized word's meaning and an integer key for negators (1),
amplifiers(2), de-amplifiers (3) and adversative conjunctions (4) with x and 
y as column names.}

\item{\ldots}{ignored.}
}
\value{
Returns a list of four items:
\item{Meta}{The number of words, sentences, and questions in the text}
\item{Attributes}{The rate of sentiment attributes relative to the number of words}
\item{Polarized_Cooccurrences}{The rate that valence shifters cooccur with a polarized word in the same sentence}
\item{Cooccurrences}{A cooccurrence matrix of sentiment attributes; `polarized` is the sum of positive and negative}
}
\description{
This function utilizes \pkg{gofastr} and \pkg{termco} to extract sentiment
based attributes (attributes concerning polarized words and valence 
shifters) from a text.  Attributes include the rate of polarized terms
and valence shifters relative to number of words.  Additionally, coocurrence
rates for valence shifters are computed.
}
\note{
\pkg{gofastr} and \pkg{termco} must be installed.  If they are not (which
they are not part of \pkg{sentimentr} install) then the function will prompt
you to attempt to install them using \code{install.packages} and
\code{ghit::install_github}.
