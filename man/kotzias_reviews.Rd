\usage{
data(kotzias_reviews)
}
\description{
A dataset containing a list of 4 review data sets.  Each data set contains
sentences with a postive (1) or negative review (-1) taken from reviews of
products, movies, & restaurants.  The data, compiled by Kotzias, Denil, De Freitas,
& Smyth (2015), was originally taken from amazon.com, imdb.com, & yelp.com.
Kotzias et al. (2015) provide the following description in the README:
"For each website, there exist 500 positive and
500 negative sentences. Those were selected randomly for larger datasets of
reviews. We attempted to select sentences that have a clearly positive or
negative connotaton [sic], the goal was for no neutral sentences to be selected.
This data set has been manipulated from the original to be split apart by
element (sentence split).  The original 0/1 metric has also been converted
to -1/1.  Please cite Kotzias et al. (2015) if you reuse the data here.
}
\details{
Each data set contains a dataframe of:
\itemize{
  \item text. The sentences from the review.
  \item rating. A human scoring of the text.
  \item element_id. An index for the original text element (row number).
  \item sentence_id. A sentence number from 1-n within each \code{element_id}.
