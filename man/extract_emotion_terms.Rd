\title{Extract Emotion Words}
\usage{
extract_emotion_terms(text.var, emotion_dt = lexicon::hash_nrc_emotions,
  un.as.negation = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{text.var}{The text variable.  Can be a \code{get_sentences} object or
a raw character vector though \code{get_sentences} is preferred as it avoids
the repeated cost of doing sentence boundary disambiguation every time
\code{emotion} is run.}

\item{emotion_dt}{A \pkg{data.table} with a \code{token} and \code{emotion}
column (\code{tokens} are nested within the \code{emotion}s.  The table
cannot contain any duplicate rows and must have the \code{token} column set
as the key column (see \code{?data.table::setkey}).  The default emotion
table is \code{lexicon::hash_nrc_emotions}.}

\item{un.as.negation}{logical.  If \code{TRUE} then emotion words prefixed
with an 'un-' are treated as a negation.  For example,\code{"unhappy"} would 
be treated as \code{"not happy"}.  If an emotion word has an un- version in the
\code{emotion_dt} then no substitution is performed and an optional warning
will be given.}

\item{\ldots}{Ignored.}
}
\value{
Returns a \pkg{data.table} with a columns of emotion terms.
}
