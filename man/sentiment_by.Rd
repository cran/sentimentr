\title{Polarity Score (Sentiment Analysis) By Groups}
\usage{
sentiment_by(text.var, by = NULL,
  averaging.function = average_downweighted_zero, group.names, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{text.var}{The text variable.  Also takes a \code{sentimentr} or
\code{sentiment_by} object.}

\item{by}{The grouping variable(s).  Default \code{NULL} uses the original
row/element indices; if you used a column of 12 rows for \code{text.var}
these 12 rows will be used as the grouping variable.  Also takes a single
grouping variable or a list of 1 or more grouping variables.}

\item{averaging.function}{A function for performing the group by averaging.
The default, \code{\link[sentimentr]{average_downweighted_zero}}, downweights 
zero values in the averaging.  Note that the function must handle 
\code{NA}s.  The \pkg{sentimentr} functions 
\code{average_weighted_mixed_sentiment} and \code{average_mean} are also 
available.  The former upweights negative when the analysts suspects the 
speaker is likely to surround negatives with positives (mixed) as a polite 
social convention but still the affective state is negative.  The later is a 
standard mean average.}

\item{group.names}{A vector of names that corresponds to group.  Generally
for internal use.}

\item{\ldots}{Other arguments passed to \code{\link[sentimentr]{sentiment}}.}
}
\value{
Returns a \pkg{data.table} with grouping variables plus:
\itemize{
  \item  element_id - The id number of the original vector passed to \code{sentiment}
  \item  sentence_id - The id number of the sentences within each \code{element_id}
  \item  word_count - Word count \code{\link[base]{sum}}med by grouping variable
  \item  sd - Standard deviation (\code{\link[stats]{sd}}) of the sentiment/polarity score by grouping variable
  \item  ave_sentiment - Sentiment/polarity score \code{\link[base]{mean}} average by grouping variable
}
}
\description{
Approximate the sentiment (polarity) of text by grouping variable(s).  For a
full description of the sentiment detection algorithm see 
\code{\link[sentimentr]{sentiment}}.  See \code{\link[sentimentr]{sentiment}}
for more details about the algorithm, the sentiment/valence shifter keys
that can be passed into the function, and other arguments that can be passed.
