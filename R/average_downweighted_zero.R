#' Downweighted Zeros Averaging
#' 
#' \code{average_downweighted_zero}- Downweight the zeros in a vector for 
#' averaging.  This is useful in the context of language where we don't want the 
#' neutral sentences to have such a strong influence on the general sentiment of 
#' the discourse with multiple sentences.  Essentially, this means neutral 
#' sentences are seen as having less emotional impact than a polarized sentence.
#' 
#' @param x A numeric vector.
#' @param na.rm logical.  Should \code{NA} values should be stripped before the 
#' computation proceeds.
#' @param \ldots ignored.
#' @return Returns a scalar summary of the re-weighted average

#' Downweighted Zeros Averaging

#' \code{average_weighted_mixed_sentiment}- Upweight the negative values in a 
#' vector while also downweighting the zeros in a vector.  Useful for small text
#' chunks with several sentences in which some one states a negative sentence
#' but then uses the social convention of several positive sentences in an 
#' attempt to negate the impact of the negative.  The affective state isn't
#' a neutral but a slightly lessened negative state.  
#' 
#' @param mixed.less.than.zero.weight The weighting factor to multiply the 
#' negative elements of the vector by (this increases the intensity of the 
#' negatives in the numerator of the mean formula).
