#' 500 negative sentences. Those were selected randomly for larger datasets of
#' reviews. We attempted to select sentences that have a clearly positive or
#' negative connotaton [sic], the goal was for no neutral sentences to be selected.
#' This data set has been manipulated from the original to be split apart by
#' element (sentence split).  The original 0/1 metric has also been converted
#' to -1/1.  Please cite Kotzias et al. (2015) if you reuse the data here.
#'

#' \itemize{
#'   \item text. The sentences from the review.

#'   \item element_id. An index for the original text element (row number).
#'   \item sentence_id. A sentence number from 1-n within each \code{element_id}.
